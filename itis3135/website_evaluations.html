            <section>
                <a href="https://www2.pnwx.com/"><h2>- Pacific Northwest X-ray Inc.-</h2></a>
                <p>They sell radiology equipment, supplies, parts and accessories</p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>C: The contrast is really bad. The background makes it hard to read the text.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>R: They achieve repitition with their list of links to their products using the same icon. It doesn't look good but it is repitition.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A: The alignment for the most part seems fine. There are some areas where images are technically aligned but it doesn't work for those specific elements.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>P: Overall, I believe that the proximity is alright. Elements that relate to a certain product are close together.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <a href="https://ninjakiwi.com/"><h2>- Ninja Kiwi -</h2></a>
                <p>Video game developer and publisher</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C: I think that contrast is managed well on this page. There is some text over the images but it has a semi-transparent background that makes it readable</li>
                    <li>R: The font stays the same for most of the website which makes it all feel well put together. The colors stay consistent throughout the website too.</li>
                    <li>A: This is done well because all the elements under the banner are well aligned even though every element isn't the same.</li>
                    <li>P: Each section is well placed. The games and news section are grouped together without needing an explicit outline.</li>
                </ul>
